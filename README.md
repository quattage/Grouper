## This addon is not even remotely usable yet. Here's what it'll do eventually:

- [x] Automatically generate a comprehensive list of collections for grouping <br />
- [x] Calculate the average polycount of a selection to determinte high/low <br />
- [ ] Automatically determine high vs low poly objects based on mesh characteristics <br />
- [ ] Group sets if high/low cooresponding meshes together based on origin location <br />
- [ ] Add bake groups to collections with cooresponding names <br />
- [ ] Allow quick renaming of bake groups and their children <br />
- [ ] Allow quick hiding of all high/low poly objects <br />
